## Lab-specific resources

### Our Github

The UNCW-iPlant Github page explains everything about what type of work we do here at the Stapleton Lab. 
The [Quickstart Guide repository](https://github.com/UNCW-iPlant/Quickstart-guide), much like this website, holds the key information on dealing with aspects of the CyVerse cyberinfrastructure and our specific suite of programs, the Validate Workflow.
All of the source code for Validate is featured on the Github site along with the Stampede application assets and the developing release (which is listed under a separate branch)

**Validate-Master repository:** https://github.com/UNCW-iPlant/Validate-Master

## Programming resources




### Software Carpentry

The Software Carpentry page is a great resource for people unfamiliar with using the command line or the Unix operating system. 
It is geared specifically toward scientists who do not have any background in programming, 
and gives a nice, basic overview of programming, software engineering, and data manipulation. 
The lessons are designed by both the Software Carpentry crew and by members of the scientific computing community. 
The web page and the source code for the lessons are hosted on Github, which Software Carpentry also gives lessons in using.

### Code Academy

Code Academy is a popular, useful resource for learning programming at either a beginner or intermediate level. 
In particular, we have found the Python lessons CodeAcademy offers especially great for teaching new recruits in what is arguably the open-source language of choice.
These lessons cover all the important points of the Python language including functions, data structures, and making use of Python's extensive standard library.

Code Academy also offers a quick and concise course on Git going into some detail about running git commands through the terminal including how to backtrack, creating new branches and the overall Git workflow.
